SIMPATICO TRAJECTORY FILE FORMAT

   File extension *.smt

   Remarks:

   1) This is a binary file format, which should be as compact as possible.
   2) The file consists of a sequence of independent frames, with no header.
   3) A postprocessor must normally also read a param and/or config file.

Trajectory file (binary):

   Frame:

      iStep
      boundary
      nAtom int
      frameFormat - bitfield with flags that include:
                    isOrdered, hasType, hasShift, hasVelocity, hasCharge, 
                    hasMolecule, nOptInt, nOptReal
      For each atom {
         id position (scaled, as 3xuint) [shift 3 x small int] [velocity]
      }
