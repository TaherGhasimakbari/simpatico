CONTENTS      this file

Setup and configuration:
------------------------

The setup script in the root directory creates a file compiler.mk by 
copying and modifying a few lines of compiler.mk_r.  The file compiler.mk_r 
(the repository version) is under version control but is not actually used 
by the build system. The generated file config.mk (the user version) is not 
kept under version control and is used by the makefile system, so that users
may modify config.mk as needed without effecting synchronization with the a 
remote git repository.

The configure script in this directory may be used to modify the choice of 
which features are enabled before compiling or recompiling the code. Enter
"configure -q" to get a list of options indicating which are currently
enabled or disabled. Further directions for using the configure script are
given in the html documentaiton. Calling the configure script in the src/ 
directory only effects options for code compiled in the src/ directory 
(i.e., in-source builds).

For compilation instructions, see the file doc/manual/user/compile.dox, 
the README file in the root directory (the parent of this directory), or
user guide section of the web documentation in doc/html.
